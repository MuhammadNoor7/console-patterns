1) Hollow Pyramid :  This C++ program prints a hollow pyramid pattern. It iterates over each level of the pyramid, printing spaces to center-align the stars and ensuring only the boundary stars are printed to create a hollow effect.


2) Rhombus :  This C++ program prints a filled pyramid (or rhombus) pattern. It iterates over each level of the pyramid, printing spaces to center-align the stars and then printing stars to fill each row completely.
